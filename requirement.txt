this is working fine. now what happens is here i select the images from the directory and then make the prediction. what i am thinking is i want to do the real time prediction for both the fruits. 

in the website what i want is an button to open the web camera to capture the image. this image will be feeding to the respective model according to the dropdown option. 

i also want to do the real time detection with the help of the the web camera.

above are the things that i want in project. now implement these things as i am telling u below.


redesign the entire website.
1.I want a greeting message each time i open the website "नमस्ते किसान!".

2.then first i want an option to select the fruit. Mango or Strawberry.

3.then i want 2 buttons below that, one is for to choose the image, and the other one to 
capture image from the webcamera/Phone camera.

4.when the user select the webcamera option the a pop up should come asking if they want to do it in real time or just to capture image.

5. if the user select capture image option then the captured image will go to the respective model. after capturing the image successfully a message should pop up that tell us image uploaded successfully.

6. if the user select the real time option then the web camera will be used for real time detection by asking for what fruit they want to do it.

7.  in the last there should be a make prediction button that will send the captured/chosen image to the respective model.

8.the processed output of the model should be shown below the make prediction button with the class name and the bounding box.
